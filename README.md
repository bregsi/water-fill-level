# Fill Level Monitoring of an Underground Rainwater Tank with Ultrasonic Sensor

Development Stage with a prototype

This project focuses on monitoring the fill level of an underground rainwater tank using an ultrasonic sensor. The tank's location makes it difficult to access physically, necessitating a sensor-based solution for accurate measurement. The project involves installing an ultrasonic sensor that detects the water level and transmits the data to a web application. Users can conveniently access the web application on their smartphones to view the real-time fill level of the rainwater tank. This monitoring system aids in efficient water management, allowing users to gauge the tank's capacity and plan water usage effectively.
